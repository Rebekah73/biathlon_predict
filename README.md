# biathlon_predict

My goal for this project was to model a biathlon race and to use the resulting model to better understand the ways in which race conditions impact performance. I then wanted to use my model to predict likely outcomes for upcoming races. I begin by briefly discussing the sport itself.

For a more detailed (and better formatted) discussion of the problem and the approach, please see the files BiathlonSummary.pdf (for English) and BiathlonSummaryFrench.pdf (pour fran√ßais).
