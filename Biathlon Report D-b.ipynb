    "# Functions to predict times\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have models to compare, we need to make predictions. Because these functions are taken directly from the previous notebook (Biathlon Report C-a), I'm going to write fairly minimally here. The five functions found below are:\n",
    "1. ```adjust_times```: It appears from looking at the data for individual racers that racer speeds generally increase somewhat linearly over time. The function adjust_times allows early career race speeds to be adjusted based on a linear fit of racer speed over all previous seasons (performed on a season by season basis) in order to try to mitigate the effects of time on speeds.\n",
    "2. ```build_racer_speed_distribution```: Creates a list of racer speeds by taking all of a given racer's speeds and then repeating them with a multiplicity that is dependent on the similarities between the conditions for the current competition and the individual prior competitions. A prior race with a similarity value of 1 (all predictor variables under consideration have identical or nearly identical values) would have its speed appear 10 times in the list. A prior race with a similarity value of 0.5 (the distance between the predictor variables under consideration is roughly half of the total spread for that variable) would have its speed appear 5 times on the list. ```build_racer_speed_distribution``` calls ```adjust_times``` to adjust the speeds for events that were held before the season under consideration to reflect general improvements in speed.\n",
    "3. ```build_racer_pr_distribution```:  Creates a list of n predicted total range times for a given racer in a given event. This is a fairly complicated process that involves the following steps:\n",
    "    1. For the given racer, determine which previous races (of both types) that racer has competed in. Collect range and accuracy (either prone or standing, depending on circumstance) into a pair of lists.\n",
    "    2. Using the weights associated to range times, produce a pair of weighted lists for range times and accuracy. Take a paired bootstrap sample (use the same ordered list of indices for both lists) and perform a linear regression on the results. The intercept is taken as the shooting time, and the slope is taken as the penalty loop time for any missed shots.\n",
    "    3. Using the weights associated to accuracy, produce a weighted list for accuracy. The mean of this list (or rather $a = (5-\\bar{x})/5$) will be taken to be the expected probability of making a particular shot. Five random values in the interval [0,1] are then computed. For each value, if the value is below $a$, the shot is made. Otherwise, the shot is missed.\n",
    "    4. The total range time is calculated as the sum of the shooting time and the product of the number of missed shots and the penalty loop time.\n",
    "4. ```racer_time_predict```: For a given racer, this function \n",
    "    1. first calls ```racer_speed_distribution```. Then, for each of the n desired predictions, it randomly selects a sample of size 10 from the returned list and computes the average.\n",
    "    2. next calls ```build_racer_pr_distribution``` twice, once for prone range times and once for standing range times. \n",
    "    3. finally, adds together the times in the resulting lists to produce a single list of n predicted race times for the given biathlete in the given race\n",
    "5. ```race_time_predictions```: calls ```racer_time_predict``` for each of the racers competing in a given race and stitches the outcomes together to form a single dataframe.\n",

    "# Evaluation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the outcomes produced by our models, we need a number of functions that allow us to compare outcomes across multiple models. In order to do this, we define several additional functions.\n",
    "1. ```place_counts```: The function ```race_time_predictions``` produces a dataframe containing one row for each competitor in a competition (with the exception of those racers who have at most a single prior race) and with $n$ columns of predicted times. The function ```place_counts``` treats each column as a running of the race, and determines, for each column, the order of finish predicted for each racer. It then aggregates this data to produce a dataframe which again has a row for each competitor, but whose columns contain the number of predicted first place finishes, second place finishes, third place finishes, etc.  \n",
    "2. ```finding_percentiles```: The function ```race_time_predictions``` produces a dataframe containing one row for each competitor in a competition (with the exception of those racers who have at most a single prior race) and with $n$ columns of predicted times. The function ```finding_percentiles``` calculates, for each individual racer, various attributes of the distribution of times predicted for that racer, among them mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and the difference between the racer's actual time and the mean of their predicted times. It then returns a dataframe which contains one row for each racer and columns for each attribute of their time distributions.\n",
    "3. ```evaluating_percentiles```: This function takes the dataframe that is output by ```finding_percentiles``` and, for each racer, determines where in that racers distribution of time predictions their actual time falls. The results are then returned as a two column dataframe containing the racers' names in the first column and the code for the location of their actual times within their distributions as the second. The codes for the different parts of the distribution range are as follows:\n",
    "    - 0 : actual time is faster than the minimum predicted time\n",
    "    - 1 : actual time is between the minimum and the 5th percentile of the predicted times\n",
    "    - 2 : actual time is between the 5th percentile and the 10th percentile of the predicted times\n",
    "    - 3 : actual time is between the 10th percentile and the 25th percentile of the predicted times\n",
    "    - 4 : actual time is between the 25th percentile and the median of the predicted times\n",
    "    - 5 : actual time is between the median and the 75th percentile of the predicted times\n",
    "    - 6 : actual time is between the 75th percentile and the 90th percentile of the predicted times\n",
    "    - 7 : actual time is between the 90th percentile and the 95th percentile of the predicted times\n",
    "    - 8 : actual time is between the 95th percentile and the maximum of the predicted times\n",
    "    - 9 : actual time is slower than the maximum predicted time\n",
    "4. ```evaluating_place_counts```: This function takes the dataframe that is output by ```place_counts``` and, for each racer, determines with what frequency the predicted place is correct, within one place of being correct, within two places of being correct, within five places of being correct, within ten places of being correct, and within twenty places of being correct. (For example, a racer who actually finished 35th would have all predicted finishes between 30th and 40th counted when determining the value for beining within five places of being correct.) It then returns a dataframe with one row for each competitor and one column for each of the seven categories under consideration.\n",
    "5. ```evaluating_dist_from_mean```: This function takes the dataframe output by ```finding_percentiles```. It uses the column ```dist_from_mean``` to determine for what percentage of the biathletes the mean of their distributions were within 10 seconds of their actual times, within 25 seconds of their actual times, within 50 seconds of their actual times, within 100 seconds of their actual times, within 150 seconds of their actual times, and within 200 seconds of their actual times. The result is then returned as a dataframe with only a single column. For reference, a change of 10 seconds in finishing time corresponds to a difference (on average) of 4-5 places in finishing place, while a change in finishing time of 100 seconds corresponds to a difference (on average) of 36-37 places in finishing place.\n",
    "6. ```average_from_mean```: This function takes the ```diff from mean``` column from the dataframe output by ```finding_percentiles``` and calculates both the mean of the values in the column and the mean of the absolute values of the entries in the column and returns both values as floats. The first computation gives us some indication of how balanced our errors in prediction are with respect to the actual times, since positive and negative values will cancel each other out. The second computation gives us an indication of overall error. In the case that the absolute values of these two numbers are the same (or nearly the same), it is an indication that the values being predicted tend to fall consistantly too high or too low.\n",
    "7. ```check_predictions```: This function takes the dataframe produced by ```finding_percentiles``` and returns a dataframe that, for each racer, indicates (via ```True``` or ```False```) whether that racer's actual time fell in the middle 50% of his predicted time distribution and whether his actual time fell in the middle 90% of his predicted time distribution.\n",
    "8. ```inside_outside```: This function takes the dataframe produced by ```check_predictions``` and returns two floats. The first is the percentage of the racers for whom the actual time fell inside of the middle 50% of their distribution, and the second is the percentage of the racers for whom the actual time fell inside of the middle 90% of their distribution.\n",

    "# Probability Distribution Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the quality of the predictions made by my model it seemed that there were two possibilities. The first, and most obvious, was to simply compare the outcomes of my model to the actual race times. Using this method of evaluation, we might say that if a racer's time for a particular race is 1500 seconds, and it is predicted to be 1501 seconds, that the model is good, while if the racer's time is predicted to be 1500 seconds but is predicted to be 1530 seconds, the model is bad. Similarly, if a racer's most likely finish is predicted to be in the top 5, and that racer finishes third, we might say that the model is good, while if the racer finishes seventh, we might say that the model is bad. The problem here is that, given the nature of biathlon, if these are the requirements to find a _good_ model, it may well be impossible to find anything but a _bad_ model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk briefly about why this might be. To begin with, the shooting aspect of biathlon adds an aspect of randomness that significantly impacts overall times. On average, a penalty lap adds 25 seconds to a racer's time directly, and also (in many cases), indirectly, as a more fatigued racer is likely to be marginally slower at the end of a race. Because these shots are independent events, it is not impossible that a biathlete who normally shoots with 90% accuracy might miss 8 out of his 10 shots (for a total time penalty in the neighborhood of over 3 minutes). Similarly, a biathlete who normally shoots with 50% accuracy might make all ten shots, which might make a particular race more than 2 minutes faster than anticipated. In addition, while it seems clear that conditions affect speed, accuracy, and shooting times, it also seems clear that the condition information that we have available is not sufficient to fully explain changes in speed, etc, even in the case that we included all of the details on all of the condition variables that we have. In other words, while we might be able to find a _best_ model for these races, we will probably be unable to find a _good_ model in the sense given above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of this, the best approach for evaluating the current model seems to be to compare its results to the results obtained by a naive model of the situation. That might be constructed in the following way: \n",
    "1. Observe that, for each racer, we find a wide variety of total times for the sprint race. For instance, for the last season's sprint races for Tarjei Boe, we find total times ranging from 1360 seconds to 1642 seconds, with a mean time of 1519 seconds and a standard deviation of 82.53 seconds. As a result, any naive model we choose should reflect this uncertaintly.\n",
    "2. Observe that it seems reasonable to think of these values as being drawn from some sort of distribution. We can use (and did, elsewhere) use the scipy.stats module to find the best fitting probability distribution for all of the racers who competed in at least 80 races, and to choose the probability distribution that best represented the most racers. Of the nearly 90 distributions available for consideration, only four appeared more than once in the list of best models for the 34 racers with at leat 80 times. Inspection of them revealed that two were symmetric and bimodal, neither of which was an attribute that seemed to realistically model the data that I was actually seeing. The other two, <a href = \"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.exponnorm.html\">stat.exponnorm</a> and <a href = \"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.johnsonsb.html\">stat.johnsonsb</a> both displayed the single peaked somewhat skewed distribution that seemed to best fit the data that I was looking at. When I tried to determine which of the two models was better over the same 34 races, I found that exponnorm was better for 17, and that johnsonsb was better for 17. I decided that since exponnorm has one fewer parameter to tune than johnsonsb, and that for at least some of the racers in some of the races we would be working with relatively few prior competitions, the better choice here would be to use exponnorm as the fit.\n",
    "3. Decide that a reasonable (naive) model would be to assume that the total times for each racer are drawn from an exponentially modified normal distribution, and that, further, we can get a good estimate of this by fitting an exponnorm distribution to all prior data and drawing values from this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these assumptions, we build our model using the following functions:\n",
    "1. ```racer_from_dist_draw```: This function takes the name of a racer and the codes (year and event) specifying a particular sprint competition, gets the race times for all previous races, fits an exponnorm distribution to them, and then randomly draws n predicted times from the distribution.\n",
    "2. ```predictions_from_dist_draw```: This function calls ```racer_from_dist_draw``` for each competitor in a given race and returns a dataframe with a row for each competitor and $n$ columns, one for each predicted time (for a given competitor).\n",
    "3. ```dist_draw_evaluate_on_season```: This function calls ```predictions_from_dist_draw``` for each event in the given season. It then returns four objects (which are the same as the objects returned by ```evaluate_on_season``` in weighted season prediction).\n",
    "    1. median_places_correct : a dataframe containing the concatenated outputs of the medians of the results of ```evaluating_place_counts``` for the events in the given season. In other words, a dataframe which contains one column for each event in the season, whose entries are the medians of the columns of the dataframes produced by ```evaluating_place_counts```. \n",
    "    2. distance_percentages : a dataframe containing the concatenated outputs of all the results of ```evaluating_dist_from_mean``` for the events in the given season.\n",
    "    3. averages_from_mean : an array containing the outputs of ```average_from_mean``` for each event in the given season.\n",

    "The next thing that I want to do is to make some sort of comparison for each of the four measure types that I've produced. I'd like to compare each of my three weighted models to the exponentially modified normal distribution model, and, assuming that they come out better than the exponentially modified normal distribution model, I'd like to decide which of those models seems to be the best. In order to do this, I began by defining some functions.\n",
    "1. ```center_percents_compare```: This function takes two dataframes (df and df1) produced by using ```evaluate_on_season``` or ```dist_draw_evaluate_on_season``` for two different models (namely, the output ```percentages_in_center```). For each race under consideration, it determines whether df or df1 has the larger value for ```inside_50``` (in other words, whether the first model or the second has a higher percentage of racers with actual times in the middle 50% of their predicted distributions). It then counts the number of times that the first model (df) is better, the number of times that the second model (df1) is better, and the number of times that they have the same value. The function then does the same thing using the ```inside_80``` columns of the dataframes. It then returns a dataframe with the results.\n",
    "2. ```averages_from_mean_compare```: This function takes two dataframes (df and df1) produced by using produced ```evaluate_on_season``` or ```dist_draw_evaluate_on_season``` for two different models (namely, the output ```average_from_mean```). For each race under consideration, it determines which model has a lower absolute value for ```average``` and which has the lower value for ```abs_ave```. These are then counted to determine in how many cases of each type the first model fairs better, in how many cases the second model fairs better, and in how many cases they fair the same. The results are then return in the form of a dataframe.\n",
    "3. ```clean_up_dataframe```: This function takes a block diagonal dataframe and returns a dataframe in which all blocks have been moved to the top of the dataframe.\n",
    "4. ```median_place_correct_compare```: This function takes two dataframes (df and df1) produced by using produced ```evaluate_on_season``` or ```dist_draw_evaluate_on_season``` for two different models (namely, the output ```median_places_correct```). For each race, it determines which of the two models (if either) fairs better in each of the 7 different categories. It then counts over all races under consideration and returns the results in the form of a dataframe.\n",
    "5. ```median_percent_improvement```: This function takes the same two dataframes as ```median_place_correct_compare``` and divides the race categories into three groups: those where the first model performed better, those where the second model performed better, and those where the two models performed equally well. For the race categories in the first group, the function that calculates the percentage improvement of the first model over the second and computes the mean of these improvements. For the race categories in teh second group, the function calculates the percentage improvement of the second model over the first and computes the mean of these improvements. These two values are then returned.\n",
    "6. ```distances_compare```: This function takes two dataframes (df and df1) produced by using produced ```evaluate_on_season``` or ```dist_draw_evaluate_on_season``` for two different models (namely, the output ```distance_percentages```). For each race, it determines which of the two models (if either) fairs better in each of the 6 different categories. It then counts over all races under consideration and returns the results in the form of a dataframe.\n",
    "7. ```distance_percent_improvement```: This function takes the same two dataframes as ```distances_compare``` and divides the race categories into three groups: those where the first model performed better, those where the second model performed better, and those where the two models performed equally well. For the race categories in the first group, the function that calculates the percentage improvement of the first model over the second and computes the mean of these improvements. For the race categories in teh second group, the function calculates the percentage improvement of the second model over the first and computes the mean of these improvements. These two values are then returned.\n",
    "    - N.B. There is one complication here. It is not unheard of, especially in the case of the smallest distances, for one or the other of the models to have a value of zero in their ```distance_percentages``` dataframe. This is obviously a problem, as division by zero leads to an infinite result, and therefore an infinite average. My solution has simply been to disregard these cases when finding these improvements. An obvious other choice would be to calculate straight differences rather than percent improvements.\n",

    "So what I'm seeing here is more or less what I was expecting to see here. The majority of the time, the exponentially modified normal model is doing better at producing a distribution of predicted times for which the actual time is in the middle of the distribution than the weight based models are. Why might that be? One obvious theory is that the exponentially modified normal model is better than the weight based models. Another is that the spread of the exponentially modified normal model might be considerably wider than that of the weight based models. In fact, if we look at the standard deviations of the distributions produced, we find that the standard deviations of the distributions produced by the exponentially modified normal model are more than double the standard deviations produced by the weighted models. In particular, it means that the width of the middle 50% of the exponentially modified normal distribution is approximately the same as the width of the middle 80% of the weighted distributions."

    "The most obvious complication with this model is that using it requires that we know (or at least be able to predict) something about the altitude of the race site, the snow conditions during the race, and the weather conditions during the race. While the first of these is relatively trivial to obtain by looking at one of the myriad interactive topographical world maps available on the internet, and one might reasonably be able to predict the last of them by looking at the hourly weather forecast before the beginning of the race, predicting the snow conditions poses a potential problem. The hope would be that by looking at the weather forecast, and perhaps at weather conditions for the few days prior to the event, we might be able to make some reasonable guess at what the snow conditions were likely to be like. This is certainly a shortcoming of this approach though, particularly as the snow conditions are the variable that we are using to inform our speed predictions, which account for around 80% of the total time. (And a change of 0.5 m/s in average speed over a 10000 m race produces a change in total time of around a minute and a half.)  \n",
